# cs-465
I have learned so much over the past 8 weeks in my CS 465 class. 
I used Express HTML, JavaScript, and SPA all in building my full stack project. Express acts as the framework or the structure for the front end of development. Javascript is used both in the front end and back end and acts as the main application. SPA on the other hand is a single page that functions highly for maintenance.
The backend for this full stack project used NoSQL MongoDB. This type of database is great because it is an easy and simple way to store data so that it is easily accessible and highly functionable. 
JSON and Javascript definitely have some differences. JSON will format the data whereas JavaScript will read and convert the data. 
To test my full stack development, I used microsoft powershell to alert me of any errors. I also checked by reloading the web page to see if any changes had been made. Finally, I used  postman to test as well. 
This course has been extremely fun for me. I felt I was able to learn so much while still having the guide to help walk me through with the process. Although, I do not think that I will be going into full stack development, iyt is definitely a good skill to have and I will be adding it to my resume.
